# Yahtzee

Web app for a dice game Yahtzee.\
This project started as an exercise in Colt Steele's [react course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/).\
My version is written to use Material-UI, and includes additional logic for all bonus scoring rules.\
Rules of the game can be found [here](https://www.dicegamedepot.com/yahtzee-rules/).
